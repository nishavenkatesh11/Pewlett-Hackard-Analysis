# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of the new analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, and prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

##Results
The analysis yeilded the following insights:
* There are 90,398 employees expected to retire.
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
* Therefore, there is 1 employee eligible for the mentorship program for every 58 employees retiring.
* The majority of employees retiring hold senior positions.

##Summary
The table below shows the number of positions by title that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
 

There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

### Additional query recommendations 
These two queries may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami":
* Re-run mentorship_eligibility with broader birth date range to see if deep selecting candidates will help mitigate the impact of the silver tsunami.
* Run query to determine which departments will lose the most employees in the silver tsunami to explore outsourcing or contracting options.
